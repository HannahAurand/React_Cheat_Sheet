#Accio!

Just kidding. This is actually about "Axios;" but I do wonder if they stole the name form Harry Potter. Accio is a spell to magically summon things to yourself, if you're a wizard. 

Since developers are the closest thing to wizards, they created Axios: A way to summon outside API data and make Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) commands within their front-end framework.
